# SRB2-2.0-Usable
Usable SRB2 2.0 source that can be compiled with Visual Studio 2022.
Credits to STJr for making this amazing game.

# Known Issues
- FMOD is broken, so no digital music.
- SRB2SDL is removed, so OpenGL might not be available.
- Screenshot or Movie Mode might not be available, as PNG stuff is commented out.

Feel free to make a pull request to fix these issues!
